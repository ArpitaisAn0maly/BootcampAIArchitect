# ChatGPT vs Custom RAG Chatbot (Summit AI Assistant) for VA

| Feature                          | ChatGPT                                                                 | Summit AI Assistant (Custom RAG Chatbot)                        | Why This Matters for VA                                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automated Information Retrieval** (Key RAG Advantage) | ❌ Limited document upload size and quantity. Unable to automate retrieval across multiple docs or large datasets. Each answer may only come from a single document. | ✔ Fully automated information retrieval. Can sift through multiple large documents and return answers by dynamically selecting content from many documents. | VA requires **automated document retrieval** from **large datasets** to efficiently handle a wide array of documents, ensuring an accurate and quick response. |
| **Handling Large Documents**     | ❌ **File size**: Limited to 500 MB; typically only allows up to 2-3 documents per upload. **Bulk ingestion** of large sets is not supported. | ✔ Supports large-scale document ingestion. Can manage bulk uploads, and documents of greater size (up to several GBs with Azure). | VA has **large documents** and data sets that require bulk ingestion. Azure enables **scalable, efficient document management** without file size limitations. |
| **Response Traceability**        | ❌ Cannot track response origins across multiple documents. | ✔ Provides traceability to specific documents and sections, ensuring accountability and transparency for each response. | **Traceability** is crucial for VA as it allows **auditing and accountability** for sensitive information, ensuring responses are linked to the correct source. |
| **Security and Compliance**      | ❌ **Limited Security** features for Government use, though labeled “Gov compliant.” Potential risk with privacy. | ✔ Built-in **Azure Guardrails** for enhanced security and compliance. Features such as **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** for role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, and encryption at rest ensure maximum protection and compliance with industry standards. | **Government-specific compliance** is vital. Azure ensures **highest security standards**,... |
| **Customization**                | ❌ Limited customization of behavior. No access to the **meta-prompt** guiding the underlying chatbot. only user prompt is accessable| ✔ Fully customizable behavior via meta prompts, temperature, retrieval mode, and prompt engineering. Full access to the meta-prompt for precision in customization. | VA needs **customizability** to fine-tune responses, ensuring **accuracy and precision** based on unique requirements. It is the **meta-prompt** that controls responses for your application. User prompt doesn't do that.|
| **Responsible & Ethical AI**     | ❌ Lacks explicit content filtering or safety content features for government use. | ✔ **Azure's Responsible AI** principles and **Content Filtering** tools built in, ensuring compliance with ethical standards for AI usage and output safety. | VA's need for **responsible and ethical AI** requires built-in **content safety** measures to ensure compliance and safety when interacting with public or sensitive data. VA's security impact assessment for any application requires these guradrails |
| **Multimodal Support**           | ❌ Does not support the seamless integration of multimodal inputs like radiology images. | ✔ **Azure AI** supports multimodal capabilities like analyzing radiology images, making it ideal for industries requiring rich content analysis and secure handling of sensitive data. | **VA needs multimodal support** to handle diverse data types, such as radiology images, ensuring **secure, accurate analysis** for patient care. |
| **Query Complexity**             | ❌ Not optimized for **high-complexity queries** requiring context from large, multiple documents. | ✔ Optimized for **complex queries** involving **multiple documents**, generating precise answers even from intricate datasets. | VA faces **complex queries** involving detailed information from various documents. Azure RAG architecture can effectively manage and resolve these complexities. |
| **Data Freshness**               | ❌ Limited document upload size and number. Requires **re-upload** to refresh content. | ✔ **Real-time data updates** possible with continuous data feeds into Azure Storage and the integration of a custom RAG pipeline. No need for re-uploading. | **Real-time data access** is crucial for VA’s operations to ensure up-to-date information. Continuous **data feeds** make information more accessible and fresh, removing the need for re-uploading. |
| **API Control & Cost Management**| ❌ Limited access to **API control**, higher **cost-per-use** with additional costs for document uploads. | ✔ Full **API control**, including **cost management** options for scaling, managing usage, and optimizing costs, along with **detailed logging** and analytics. | VA needs **cost-effective solutions** with transparent API control, **budget optimization**, and the ability to manage usage at scale for **long-term sustainability**. |
| **User Experience**              | ❌ User-friendly but limited interaction capabilities due to upload size restrictions. | ✔ Customizable **user experience** with flexibility in building **tailored interfaces**, offering a better experience for end-users. | VA requires a **tailored user experience** that can be **customized** to meet specific workflows and requirements. Azure’s flexibility in customization ensures a better fit for VA's needs. |
